# Hybird-Sentiment-Analysis
A powerful sentiment analysis system leveraging Snorkel for weak supervision and fine-tuned RoBERTa for high-accuracy sentiment classification. It supports CSV-based analysis with keyword filtering and real-time web scraping for sentiment extraction. Built with Flask, Goose3, and Hugging Face Transformers for seamless deployment.

📌 Overview
This project is a powerful sentiment analysis system designed to extract and analyze sentiments from text-based data efficiently. It leverages Snorkel for weak supervision and fine-tuned RoBERTa to classify text into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments with high accuracy. The system is capable of analyzing large CSV datasets with keyword-based filtering and also supports real-time web scraping for sentiment extraction from web pages.

🚀 Features
✔ Sentiment Classification – Categorizes text as positive, neutral, or negative
✔ Keyword Filtering – Analyze sentiments for specific topics in large datasets
✔ CSV Upload Support – Process bulk datasets for structured sentiment insights
✔ Web Scraping Sentiment Analysis – Extract sentiments from real-time web content using Goose3
✔ Multiple Visualizations – Generates bar charts, pie charts, and density plots for insightful analysis
✔ Flask-Based Web Interface – User-friendly web app for seamless interaction
